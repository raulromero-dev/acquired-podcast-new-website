## Why I Built This

Acquired is one of the best podcasts out there — Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal create what I'd call "conversational audiobooks" about the world's greatest companies. Their episodes on Google and Trader Joe's are masterclasses in storytelling. But the current site is a Squarespace template doing its job. 

I wanted to build something that feels as premium as the content itself.

## What's Different

**Animations with purpose** — Scroll-triggered reveals, smooth transitions, and micro-interactions that make browsing feel premium.

**Editorial design** — The "Our Approach" section highlights their philosophy (depth over breadth, primary sources, fair-minded analysis, long-term thinking) with a numbered layout that feels intentional.

**Episode experience** — Designed for transcripts and a media player that invites you to stay.

**Proposed brand identity** — A cohesive visual language across the entire site.
